# Protecting-Women-from-Safety-Threats-Using-Computer-Vision

## Problem Statement

This project aims to address the issue of women's safety in urban environments by utilizing advanced deep learning and computer vision models to detect potential safety threats in real-time. The solution leverages CCTV footage to detect and analyze safety threats such as violence, the presence of multiple men near a lone woman, suspicious activity, and more, ensuring timely alerts for prevention and intervention.

### SIH Hackathon
This project was initiated as part of the **Smart India Hackathon (SIH)**, where the focus was on developing technology-driven solutions for womenâ€™s safety. The proposed solution aims to improve real-time threat detection using AI and alert systems integrated into a CCTV framework.

The architecture of this project consists of multiple modules for detecting persons, analyzing gender ratios, detecting emotions, and generating SOS alerts when necessary. The system leverages:

- **YOLOv8** for real-time person detection.
- **MediaPipe** for pose and facial expression detection.
- **Transformers** for gender detection.
- **MobileNet** for violence detection.
- **DBSCAN and GRU** for hotspot analysis.

### Technical Approach

1. **Person Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv8 for detecting individuals in CCTV footage and tracking them across frames.
2. **Gender Detection**: Based on Transformer models, it identifies gender to detect if a woman is surrounded by multiple men.
3. **Emotion and Pose Detection**: Uses MediaPipe for facial emotion detection (like fear or distress) and body pose classification (running, walking, standing).
4. **Violence Detection**: MobileNet-based model for identifying violent activity such as fights or physical altercations.
5. **Hotspot Detection**: Using DBSCAN and GRU, the model detects locations with repeated instances of potential danger, identifying unsafe zones or "hotspots."
